# SQLFiller
I made this as a personal project before having any experience with Oracle or JDBC, which is why it simple creates the input lines as a seperate file to be copied and pasted.
All information is pseudorandom, with all possible information for inputs either coming from lists on the internet ("Top 1000 Male Baby Names!", "Full Course List | Baker College", etc) or just being generated within limited restrictions (12 months in the year, randomly pick one).
My purpose in making this was to give myself a largely populated database to better see the results of queries, instead of being shown only partial results as most of the tutorials I found online did while teaching myself about databases and MySQL.
